# Ready to Create a Subdomain for your .ape domain? 

## Here is a quick guide on how:

1. Make sure you are logged into https://ape.cloud by connecting your wallet using Metamask.
2. If you haven't already, mint a .ape domain using the instructions in the previous walkthrough.
3. Click on "Domains" in the navigation bar.
4. Find the .ape domain you wish to mint a subdomain for and click on it.
5. Once you're on the domain page, click on "Add Subdomain".
6. Type in the name of the subdomain you want to create. Note that while minting is free, you will need to pay current gas fees on all subdomains. Your subdomain also will not be associated with ENS like your domain currently is. 
7. Hit enter. You will be prompted to sign and pay any gas fees. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain. This can take a few minutes depending on the current gas fees and network congestion.
8. Once your subdomain is minted, you can update the image metadata using https://cortex.press. 
9. Congratulations! You have successfully minted a subdomain for your .ape domain.
