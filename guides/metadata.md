5. After uploading the new image, hit "publish" to save the changes to your metadata.

6. Once the changes are saved, you can find your domain on the opensea collection. The updated image should be displayed. If the image doesn't update right away, try refreshing the metadata to see the changes. https://opensea.io/collection/ape-pdmu8tocwv
