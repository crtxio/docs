First, it's important to understand what a .ape domain is and why it's valuable. Owning a .ape domain can increase privacy, security, and control over your online identity and content. Check out the 12 reasons why a .ape domain is different than other domain projects, here: https://medium.com/cortex-app/top-twelve-reasons-ape-domain-nfts-are-different-from-other-domain-name-nft-projects-c486194a47c3


1. Once you're ready to purchase a .ape domain, you'll need to receive a .ape token. You can confirm if you have a .ape token by visiting https://opensea.io/collection/ape-cloud-invitation and checking your "hidden" folder under "More". If you don't have a .ape token yet, you'll need to acquire one through a secondary market such as OpenSea or by reaching out to our team on our Telegram, https://t.me/dotapefam
2. Once you have your .ape token, visit ape.cloud and sign in using Metamask. If you don't have Metamask, you'll need to download it and set up a wallet. 
3. Enter the domain name of your choice to see if it's available for purchase. Hit "Start Purchase" to proceed to purchasing screen.
