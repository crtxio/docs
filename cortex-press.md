## Metadata

Have you successfully purchased your first .ape domain and ready to update your image metadata? We have made it simple to update the PFP image of your NFT subdomain with Cortex Press. 

### 1. 
Purchase a domain: If you haven't already purchased a .ape domain, follow the instructions on previous walkthroughs to purchase one.

### 2. 
Visit https://cortex.press and login to the wallet that currently holds your .ape domain. You can log in using a variety of methods, including Metamask or Magic.

### 3. 
Once you're logged into Cortex Press, you will see all of your domains as pages. Select the NFT domain that you want to update the image metadata for.

### 4. 
To update the image, you can drag and drop a new image directly onto the page, or click on the page to access the image box on the top left-hand corner. You can upload PNG, JPG, or GIF files up to 10 MB in size.

### 5. 
After uploading the new image, hit "publish" to save the changes to your metadata.

### 6. 
Once the changes are saved, you can find your domain on the opensea collection. The updated image should be displayed. If the image doesn't update right away, try refreshing the metadata to see the changes. https://opensea.io/collection/ape-pdmu8tocwv


By following these steps, you should be able to successfully update the image metadata on your Cortex Press NFT subdomain.
