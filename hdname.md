# HDname

HDName is a namespace system used in Cortex Network for decentralized content creation. It allows for human-readable names to be associated with keys, which can be used as Web3 URLs to point at validated content on a decentralized backend, similar to a URL in web2, but now every URL has an associated key-pair. The use of HDName makes it much easier to reference information on the Cortex Network, as the names are more memorable and easier to type than the long hexadecimal strings typically used in decentralized systems.

The HDName system is built on top of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and uses its smart contract infrastructure to manage name registrations and resolution. When a user registers a name on the Cortex Network, they are essentially creating a mapping between the name and a unique key that can be used to retrieve the associated content. This mapping is stored on the ENS smart contract, which is replicated across the network to ensure availability and redundancy.

To resolve a name to its associated content, a user simply needs to query the ENS smart contract with the name and receive the corresponding key in return. The key can then be used to retrieve the content from the decentralized backend, which is typically stored on IPFS. The content can be anything from text and images to video and audio, and can be validated using various mechanisms to ensure its authenticity and integrity.

The use of HDName on Cortex Network is particularly useful for content creators and publishers, as it allows them to easily share their content with others using a memorable and easily accessible name. This can help to increase the visibility and reach of their content, and make it more discoverable by users who may not be familiar with the underlying technical infrastructure.

Overall, HDName is a powerful tool for decentralized content creation on the Cortex Network. By providing a human-readable namespace for keys, it makes it much easier to reference and share content, and helps to promote the adoption of decentralized systems by making them more accessible to the average user.
