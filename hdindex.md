# HD Index

HDindex is a modified sparse Merkle trie that allows for fast content lookups and defines the local state in the Cortex Network. This high-efficiency, low-cost state management system generates globally verifiable localized consensus, making it a valuable tool for content publishing on the Cortex Network.
How HDindex Works

HDindex uses a modified sparse Merkle trie to store the local state of the Cortex Network. Each node in the trie represents a unique key, which is derived from the HDName system. HDName is a hierarchical deterministic naming system that allows for the creation of unique and human-readable names.

When users publish content on the Cortex Network, their data is stored in IPFS, a decentralized file storage system. The user then creates a commit, which is a signed message that contains the key and the IPFS hash of the content. The commit is then sent to the publisher, who verifies the signature and stakes CRTX to publish the new state on-chain.

Once the new state is published on-chain, it is added to the HDindex trie. The trie provides a way to quickly and efficiently look up the content by its key, which is derived from the HDName system. This enables fast content discovery and retrieval on the Cortex Network.

### Benefits of HDindex

HDindex provides several benefits to content creators and publishers on the Cortex Network. Firstly, it allows for fast and efficient content discovery and retrieval, making it easy for users to find the content they are looking for. Secondly, the use of the Ethereum blockchain and the HDName system ensures that the content is stored securely and can be easily verified by anyone.

Additionally, HDindex is a low-cost state management system that generates globally verifiable localized consensus. This means that the state of the Cortex Network can be This means that the state of the Cortex Network can be easily verified by anyone, making it a transparent and trustworthy platform for content publishing.

### Conclusion
HDindex is a key component of the Cortex Network that allows for fast and efficient content discovery and retrieval. Using the HDName system, HDindex provides a secure and transparent platform for content creation and distribution. Its low-cost state management system generates globally verifiable localized consensus, making it a valuable tool for content publishing on the Cortex Network.
