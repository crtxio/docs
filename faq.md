## What is Cortex Network? 

Cortex is a scalable foundation for just about any kind of content on Web3, the user-owned web. That means you could build social apps where the users own their social posts or a private document network for communities like DAOs where the documents are all proven and signed with multisig by the authorized parties, or a gallery for your artwork. The opportunities to build are really limitless.

## How is Cortex App different from typical note-taking or web-publishing tools? 

With Cortex, each individual owns their information: their notes, their documents. Only the person with the keys can control them. In addition, Cortex enables private channels in the same network. So you can choose what’s private and what’s public. Finally, with Cortex’s blockchain links or, “blinks.” You can set up messaging systems between Cortex wallet addresses.

## How does cortex enable “Web3 for everyone?” 

First, we’ve given away .hmn domains so that anyone can get started in Web3. These domains will act as your identity in the Cortex app and are completely self-sovereign and full NFTs. You can also build your digital kingdom where you sell subdomains, so if you have ‘gates.hmn,’ you can sell ‘bill.gates.hmn’ to someone else but maintain custody of the gates.hmn domain overall. In addition, these domains, combined with your keys, create the namespace for all your data. You can think of this namespace like a filestore or folder pathway for all your stuff.

# Data on Cortex Network and in the Cortex App
## How does a user own their data on Cortex? 

Cortex is a ‘trustless’ distributed system. That means, much like cryptocurrency, the key-holder controls the assets in their wallet, the ones attached to their crypto address and public/private keys. The same is true for data in the Cortex network; only the key-holder can access and edit their content unless it’s made public.

## How will cortex work with IPFS will there be other backends for data we can use? 

Cortex uses much of the current IPFS standards and hashing, so in the near-term IPFS will be the simplest. With demand, we do plan on offering encrypted data hosting wherever users want it to be hosted, AWS, Google, your their own servers, etc. The backend is flexible.

## Is the user’s data visible to Cortex? 

In the version to be launched first, all info will be public by default since the main use case now is making public web3 sites. But soon we will offer a version that is encrypted by default and, unless intentionally flagged as public, your data is only visible to the user and those with the channel code. Cortex App makes the data easy to code and use, but the data is only read and edited by the user. We will also enable private collaboration groups in future versions.

# The Cortex Content Network and Publishing

## How do the nodes in Cortex work and coordinate? 
The nodes in the Cortex Network are called Press Nodes. They operate in mostly a chain-independent manner. The nodes operate the network and enable publishers to collect and validate updates to the network via HDIndex, which allows a simple hash to define the current state of content in the network. Press nodes can then retrieve and display that content.

## How will the Content Network use the $CRTX tokens? 

$CRTX tokens will be used much like any Proof of Stake system. Publishers will stake a certain amount of token. The token amount staked determines the frequency with which a publisher can publish. Could be once per minute or once per month. That’s up to the publisher.

## What is the role of publishers on the Cortex network? 

Publishers work very much like miners in a Proof of Stake Blockchain network. They operate nodes, validate transactions, and receive rewards for staking. Publishers receive more rewards the more total publishing happens on the network, so each publisher has an incentive to publish. Publishers spend $CRTX every time they publish. At least part of that $CRTX is distributed to other publishers based on the amount they stake. It isn't distributed to all token holders.
A publisher also publishes multiple updates (commits) each time they publish. That means they aren't doing a transaction for every change but rather they publish a single release which contains many commits, a key scalability feature.

## What is the relationship between Publishers and Users? 

The relationship between publishers and users is really up to them. You can self-publish and be your own publisher. You might charge people to publish, or you might curate what you publish in a marketplace or news publication setting. While users own their data, the publishers maintain control over what they publish. The relationship between publishers and users also adds a new layer of privacy, as the publisher’s keys are used to publish, not the users, even as the user signs with their keys, their commits are provable, but not used to write on-chain.

## What are the advantages to the publishers for joining the Cortex network? 

Just as any kind of news service or application runs on web2 today, the opportunity is to pull together and publish conversations within your community, but do it in a way that is validated and secured for the users. Then, of course, publishers receive rewards from the network for staking. The more publishing that takes place on the network, the more of a reward each publisher receives.But at the most basic level, the reason to be a publisher is so that you can publish content. That can range from an individual wanting to self publish all the way up to a service provider publishing content for their customers. It could be a company publishing content for their employees to create an internal knowledge base, a project using it to manage code, documentation, and community all in one place, or anywhere in-between.

## How will I select a publisher to publish my content?

 Users will choose publishers the same way you might choose a social platform or marketplace today. You publish where you want your content to be seen. The benefit with Cortex is, you still own and control your content, not the publisher. A user can send same content to multiple publishers.

# Butterfly Protocol Domains on Cortex

## How do domain names work within Cortex?

 Domain names in Cortex are based on Butterfly Protocol Domain Names, which are Web3-smart-contract-governed, DNS-based names. They are full NFTs, meaning they have much wider use cases and can have many more attributes than current Web3 domains. They can do more than just resolve addresses. They can hold data and other information (and more to come.)

## What kinds of things can one publish? 
There is a wide variety of file types supported. The Cortex application itself will use markdown, but the backend is based on git, so just about any git-supported file type can be used. These currently include:
PNG (.png) GIF (.gif) JPEG (.jpg) SVG (.svg) Log files (.log) Microsoft Word (.docx), Powerpoint (.pptx), and Excel (.xlsx) documents Text files (.txt) PDFs (.pdf) ZIP (.zip, .gz) Video (.mp4, .mov)
## Are there size limits?

Each node (note, document or page) is currently a folder on IPFS, so will have the same limits as IPFS.

## How do I claim a domain name? 

We pride ourselves on making a “Web3 for Everyone”. That means making it simple and inexpensive. You can claim a domain in 2 clicks or less for free at https://hmn.domains to get started. We will have paid TLDs shortly, and working with partners to create new TLDs that will allow anyone to claim domains there.

## Can anyone get a Butterfly top-level domain, or TLD? 

Creating a fully-owned TLD requires 100,000 BFLY tokens, so there will only ever be at most 1000 fully-owned TLDs. So having one will be a rare commodity. Get yours soon! There are also community sponsored TLDs that are limited to Ethereum and are not as flexible as fully-owned TLDs. Anyone with enough $BFLY can sponsor a TLD. Yes, anyone, true decentralized control.

## What does it mean that I can edit the metadata on my Butterfly Domain NFT? 

Unlike several decentralized domain name systems, Butterfly domains are full NFTs and can issue subdomain NFTs that are also full NFTs.

For example, you can’t take an ENS NFT and change the metadata to add custom art to it. You can’t use the NFT that represents your domain for anything else.

Metadata for these Butterfly NFTs can be edited in the following ways:
If you buy a domain, you can set the image associated with the NFT so that it shows a picture of you for example. If you have a game, and use the Butterfly NFTs for items you can set different information, like charge level and the longer the NFT is held the charge information is updated over item. You can create custom attributes. You have a name for your NFT, but also a location in Web3 for endless multimedia storytelling with the Cortex App. Other direction, then you have the tree structure, so you get the sub-NFTs and you get the name and the site, you can think of thes like enhanced DVDs, you can keep adding new features. 

## Can you mint subdomain NFTs? 
Yes! How are Butterfly Protocol Domains, like .hmn, .ape, and .crtx different from other Web3 decentralized domains? Butterfly domains currently resolve across both Ethereum and Polygon, with more chains coming, reducing the complexity of integrations. Butterfly domain names are full NFTs, meaning you can edit the metadata and even issue full NFT subdomains. So you could sell a piece of art as an NFT, for example, that would have a home on the Web as well as on chain. *How it will work: You might issue NFT1.Series3.web3monet.hmn as an NFT with the art IN it. Then the art has a life on the web, but can be transacted as NFT as well. Full domains also mean potentially lifetime ownership, or until sold: Each web3 domain name project handles things a little differently. Several have their own blockchain and require yearly renewal fees. Butterfly domains, once owned, are owned for life or until sold, like any other NFT. No renewal fees. Butterfly Protocol is an alternate root meaning Butterfly can issue multiple TLDs (top-level domains) and let the community choose what TLDs are sponsored. You could, if you wanted, create a .web3monet TLD, for example. if you have say, web3monet.io on web2 you could tie those domains to it and publish there as well. So everything that you have on .web3monet TLD within will also appear on legacy web (web2) at web3monet.io. Full NFTs allow for cool new use cases such as gaming and tracking partial ownership of real world goods by issuing those subdomains. Overall Butterfly takes a more holistic approach and building multiple components to support dapp development through Cortex. Naming is just the first phase and the tip of the iceberg. Cortex then enables real utility for publishing around those domains.


# Technical

## How is the cortex state management system different from a state machine? 
Cortex doesn’t measure specific changes to a set of content, say a single character change when editing a document. We only track what the current state is, and we have a history of those former states. This works better and more efficiently, we believe, than a state machine for most content use cases. The idea is very similar to how git manages changes. The specific changes made can be done in a comparison of states after the fact.

## Will the platform be open source?

The Cortex Network will be open source. We are long-time believers and contributors to open source, but on a practical level, just like Ethereum or other blockchains, crypto networks have to be or they can’t be trusted.

## What can we build on Cortex and how will it be discoverable and interconnected to other tech? 

Content on Cortex will be public to start, and will be available on the legacy web at a domain related to your Cortex domain. A alice.hmn domain may be alice.hmn.link or alice.hmn.io on the legacy web, for example. So these will be discoverable through current search engines. Web3-specific search engines will also be an opportunity, however. Is it free? At first, yes, but eventually Cortex will be another publisher and we will build in a reasonable pricing model using Cortex as a publisher to start, but then we’ll add others at launch of the full network. What’s the cost? Cost for publishing will depend on each publisher, how often they publish. Cortex will be a publisher as well and we will provide our pricing model at a later date. 

## What’s possible in the bigger picture and what’s the timeline? 

Any easy way to think of the bigger picture is “What if the entire web and everything in it was a social network? And an economy of content?” When you tie together Content, Identity and value transfer, that’s what you get. We are personally interested in what this can do, say, for sharing and tracking scientific data, but the opportunities are really limitless.
