# Tokenomics of Cortex:

Cortexâ€™s token, $CRTX, is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Polygon blockchain. The token is used to facilitate transactions within the Cortex ecosystem and to reward users for contributing to the platform's growth and development. $CRTX is used to pay for services on Cortex, such as hosting notes, accessing premium features, and creating and sending collectibles or NFTs.

The allocation of $CRTX tokens to the community is intended to incentivize users to use the platform and contribute to its growth. A portion of the tokens allocated to the community is set aside for user rewards, such as airdrops and referral bonuses. By rewarding users, the platform encourages greater participation and engagement, which in turn drives growth and development.

Benefits of CRTX tokens and .crtx subdomains:
- CRTX tokens are utility tokens for operating in the Cortex ecosystem
- Staking $CRTX allows a publisher to do on chain commits of the root hash of content for their site or app. How much is staked determines how often the publisher can write on chain. The more you stake, the more often you can update on-chain.
- Owning a subdomain under the .crtx TLD will enable users to have a globally unique set of unlimited addresses for creating, sharing and communicating around their content. It's a browser, content creation, social media and messaging application in one.
- Yes, you can use emojis as part of your domain, or all of your domain.
- Token holders will be able to pin data on IPFS.
- Each domain within crtx TLD is an NFT, an ERC-721 token that becomes an identity and place for owning, communicating, storing and using the Cortex app.
- Owning this domain will not only provide you with a globally unique ID to interact and show what you own at a specific time, but the domain will also act as channels on which you can interact and with others.
- This NFT can be sold like any other, but you can move your digital creations and assets elsewhere as needed.
- Cross-chain functionality will be enabled.
- Your identity is an NFT, but each key can also hold NFTs and showcase content and imagery around it. Many new ways to build structures of NFTs for sale, for personal airdrops, for just about anything.
- Endless digital asset creation beyond NFTs. Virtually anything you create can become a public or private asset as everything has an immutable identity, owner, and timeline.
